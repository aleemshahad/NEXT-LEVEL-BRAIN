- Creates trade memories for continuous learning
- Prepares your AI brain for live trading

**Choose from:**
- **Quick Training** (30 days) - Fast setup
- **Standard Backtest** (90 days) - Recommended
- **Full Historical** (365 days) - Maximum training
- **AI Training Only** - Use sample data

### **STEP 2: Start Live Trading** 📈
```bash
python main.py
```
**What this does:**
- Shows pair selection menu (Gold, Bitcoin, Forex, etc.)
- Starts AI-enhanced live trading
- Opens dashboard for monitoring
- Begins continuous AI learning from real trades

## ⚙️ **CONFIGURATION**

### **Key Settings (config/config.yaml):**
```yaml
# AI Brain Settings
ai_brain:
  enabled: true                    # Enable AI enhancement
  confidence_threshold: 0.6        # Minimum AI confidence
  override_enabled: true           # Allow AI to override ICT signals
  learning_enabled: true           # Continuous learning

# Multi-timeframe Analysis
multi_timeframe:
  primary_timeframe: "H4"         # Trend analysis
  execution_timeframe: "M15"      # Entry timing
  min_confluence_score: 0.7       # Quality filter
```

## 🛠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues:**

**"No trades being taken"**
- ✅ This is normal! AI waits for high-quality setups
- ✅ System requires 70% confluence score
- ✅ Multi-timeframe alignment needed
- ✅ Professional trading = patience

**"AI not learning"**
- Run training first: `python backtest_and_train.py`
- Check AI status in dashboard
- Ensure learning_enabled: true in config

**"Dashboard not opening"**
- Install dependencies: `pip install streamlit plotly`
- Dashboard is optional - trading works without it

**"Connection errors"**
- Check MT5 is running
- Verify account credentials in config
- Ensure demo account is active
